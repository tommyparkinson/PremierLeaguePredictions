# PremierLeaguePredictions
Machine Learning Python

This project I have implemented a Bayes and Poisson algorithm to make predictions on english premier league matches.
The profitablity of the algorithms has been calculated using Bet365 odds.
Bayes algorithm makes the prediction based on home and away teams previous win/draw/loss percentages.
Poisson algorithm makes predictions based on how many goals a team has scored and conceeded.

Current profitibabilty not very good. More testing with with more data needs to be done but the algorithms work as they should.

Future Work
1. Adding more features such as starting XI, manager, weather etc...
2. Predictions for under/over 2.5 goals
3. Predictions for both teams to score.
